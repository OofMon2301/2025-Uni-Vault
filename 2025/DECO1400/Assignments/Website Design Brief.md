# Website Design Ideas and Briefing
Any topic that you are interested in (I will probably do something about the military, something maybe about some of the fighter jets or tanks that have capabilities that we might not know or talk about a lot.)

## Requirements
- 10 pages maximum (not including titles, references, or appendices)
## Introduction
> What is the website about?

I think I will have pages of websites that talk about the products of the companies that make advanced fighters and helicopters in different nations (such as USA, Europe, China, Russia, etc.).
> Who is the target audience?

The target audience are enthusiasts that want to either learn more about planes and are interested about them or people that are not well conversed in planes (such as I) and want to learn more as they stumbled into them and find them fascinating and cool.
> Why did you come up with the idea?

I thought it was an interesting topic to make and I enjoy learning and talking about it more, even though I do not have the biggest grasp of the idea.

## Site Map
Needs to have similar structure to this, will make it on a website or something similar of the sort.

## High Fidelity Prototype of The Website 

***You need to use the design tool from Week 4 Lecture Slides to be able to do this, I don't know if it is mandatory but it is best to as long as it works.***

## Design decisions 
***You need to state the design decisions that you have made based on Nielsen's Usability Heuristics.***

## Conclusion
Summary of the report and deliveries, challenges that you have faced and the future work that you have to show for.
