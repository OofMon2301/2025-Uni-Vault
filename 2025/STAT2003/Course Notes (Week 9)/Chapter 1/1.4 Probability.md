## Definition 1.2 - Probability Measure
A probability $\mathbb{P}$ is a rule (function) which assigns a positive number to each event, and which satisfies the following **axioms**:
1. Axiom 1: $\mathbb{P}(A) \geq 0$.
2. Axiom 2: $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$ ^6a4d9a
3. For any sequence $A_{1},A_{2},\dots$ of disjoint events we have
$$
\mathbb{P}\left( \bigcup_{i}A_{i} \right) = \sum_{i} \mathbb{P}(A_{i})
$$
[[#^6a4d9a|Axiom 2]] states that the probability of the certain event $\Omega$ is 1. 

## Theorem 1.1 - Properties of a Probability Measure
Let $A$ and $B$ be events. Then,
1. $\mathbb{P}(\emptyset) = 0$
2. $A \subset B \implies \mathbb{P}(A) \leq \mathbb{P}(B)$
3. $\mathbb{P}(A) \leq 1$
4. $\mathbb{P}(A^c) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A)$
5. $\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A)+\mathbb{P}(B)-\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$

Proof:
1. Since $\Omega = \Omega \cup \emptyset$, we have, by the sum rule, $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = \mathbb{P}(\Omega) + \mathbb{P}(\emptyset)$, and therefore, by the second axiom, $1=1+\mathbb{P}(\emptyset)$, from which it follows that $\mathbb{P}(\emptyset)=0$.
2. If $A \subset B$, then $B=A \cup (B \cap A^c)$, where $A$ and $B \cap A^c$ are disjoint. Hence, by the sum rule, $\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B+A^c)$, which is (by the first axiom) greater than or equal to $\mathbb{P}(A)$.
3. This follows directly from property 2 and axiom 2, since $A \subset \Omega $.
4. $\Omega = A \cup A^c$, where $A$ and $A^c$ are disjoint. Hence, by the sum rule and axiom 2: $1 = \mathbb{P}(\Omega) = \mathbb{P}(A)+P(A^c)$, and thus $\mathbb{P}(A^c) = 1-\mathbb{P}(A)$.
5. Write $A \cup B$ as the disjoint union of $A$ and $B \cap A^C$. Then, $\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A)+\mathbb{P}(B\cap A^c)$. Also, $B=(A \cap B) \cup (B \cap A^c)$, so that $\mathbb{P}(B)=\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) + \mathbb{P}(B \cap A^c)$. Combining these two equations gives $\mathbb{P}(A \cup B)=\mathbb{P}(A)+\mathbb{P}(B)-\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$.

In many applications the sample space is *countable*, i.e. $\Omega = \{ a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n} \}$ or $\Omega = \{ a_{1},a_{2},\dots \}$. Such a sample space is called **discrete**.

The easiest way to specify a probability $\mathbb{P}$ on a discrete sample space is to specify first the probability $p_{i}$ of each **elementary event** $\{ a_{i} \}$ and then to define
$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \sum_{i:a_{i}\in A} p_{i}, \quad \text{for all }A \subset \Omega 
$$
## Theorem 1.2 - Equilikely Principle
If $\Omega$ has a finite number of outcomes, and all are equally likely, then the probability of each event $A$ is defined as
$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} 
$$
When the sample space is not countable, for example $\Omega = \mathbb{R}_{+}$, it is said to be **continuous**.
