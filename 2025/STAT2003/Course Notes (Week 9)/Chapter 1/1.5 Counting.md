# 1.5 - Counting

To be able to comfortably solve a multitude of counting problems requires a lot of experience and practice, and even then, some counting problems remain exceedingly hard.

A multiple choice form has 20 questions; each question has 3 choices. In how many possible ways can the exam be completed?

## Drawing with Replacement, Ordered
Here, after we draw each ball, note the number on the ball, and put the ball back. Let $n=4,k=3$. Some possible outcomes are $(1,1,1),(4,1,2),(2,3,2),(4,2,1),\dots$. To count how many such arrangements there are, we can reason as follows, we have three positions to fill in. Each position can have the numbers 1,2,3, or 4, so the total number of possibilities is $4 \times 4 \times 4 =4^{3}=64$. This is illustrated via the following tree diagram:

For general $n$ and $k$ we can reason analogously to find the number of ordered arrangements of $k$ numbers chosen from $\{ 1,\dots,n \}$ with replacement (repetition) is $n^k$.

## Drawing without Replacement, Ordered
Here we draw again $k$ numbers (balls) from the set $\{  1,2,\dots,n \}$ and note the order, but now do not replace them. Let $n=4$ and $k=3$. Again there are 3 positions to fill but now the numbers cannot be the same, e.g. $(1,4,2),(3,2,1)$. Such an ordered arrangements called a **permutation** of size $k$ from the set $\{ 1,\dots,n \}$ For the $1^{st}$ position has been chosen, we have only 3 possibilities left for the second position. And after the first two positions have been chosen there are 2 positions left. So the number of arrangements is $4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$.

For general $n$ and $k$ we have:

The number of permutations of size $k$ from $\{ 1,\dots,n \}$ is $^nP_{k}=n(n-1)\dots(n-k+1)$.

In particular, when $k=n$, we have that the number of ordered arrangements of $n$ items is $n\neq n(n-1)(n-2)\dots 1$, where $n!$ is the called the $n$ -factorial. Note that
$$
^nP_{k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$
