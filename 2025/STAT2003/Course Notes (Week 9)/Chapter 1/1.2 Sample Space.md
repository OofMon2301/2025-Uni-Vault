# 1.2 Sample Space
---
Although we cannot predict the outcome of a random experiment with certainty we usually can specify a set of possible outcomes. This gives the first ingredient in our model for a random experiment.


> [!NOTE] Sample Space
> The **sample space** $\Omega$ of a random experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.

Examples of random experiments with their sample spaces are:
1. Casting two dice consecutively
$$
\Omega = \{ (1,1), (1,2), \dots, (1,6), (2,1), \dots , (6,6) \}
$$
2. The lifetime of a machine (in days)
$$
\Omega = \mathbb{R}_{+} = \{  \text{positive real numbers}\}
$$
3. The number of arriving calls at an exchange 
$$
\Omega = \{  0,1,\dots \} = \mathbb{Z}_{+}
$$
4. The heights of 10 selected people
 $$
\Omega = \{( x_{1},\dots,x_{10}) , x_{i} \geq 0, i=1,\dots,10 \} = \mathbb{R}^{10}_{+}
$$
Here $(x_{1},\dots,x_{10})$ represents the outcome that the length of the first selected person is $x_{1}$, the length of the second selected person is $x_{2},$ etc.
