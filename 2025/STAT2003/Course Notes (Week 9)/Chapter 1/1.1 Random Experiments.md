# 1.1 Random Experiments
---
The basic notion in probability is that of a **random experiment**; an experiment whose outcome cannot be determined in advance, but is nevertheless still subject to analysis.

Examples of random experiments are:
1. Tossing a die
2. Measuring the amount of calls arriving at a telephone exchange during a fixed time period
3. Selecting a random sample of fifty people and observing the number of left handers
4. Choosing at random ten people and measuring their height

## Example 1.1 - Coin Tossing
The most fundamental stochastic experiment is the experiment where a coin is tossed a number of times, say $n$ times. 
The following python program below simulates 100 tosses with a fair coin.

```python title:coin_toss.py
from numpy.random import rand
from numpy import cumsum, arange
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 100
x = (rand(n) < 0.5).astype(int)
plt.figure(1)
plt.bar(arange(n),x)
```

Good examples of random experiments include, but are not limited to:
- Coin tossing on a fair coin
- Computer generated plant growth
- Number of bytes transferred over computer link
