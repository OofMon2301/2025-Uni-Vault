# 1.3 Events
---
Sometimes we are not just interested in a single outcome but a group of outcomes occur. Such subsets of the sample space are called **events**. Events will be denoted by capital letters A, B, C etc. We say that event A occurs if the outcome of the experiment is one of the elements in A.

Examples of such events are:
1. The event that the sum of two dice is 10 or more:
$$
A = \{ (4,6), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) \}
$$
2. The event that a machine lives less than 1000 days:
$$
A=[0,1000)
$$
3. The event that out of 50 selected people, five are left handed: 
$$
A=\{ 5 \}
$$
Since events are sets, we can apply the usual set operations to them:

- The set $A \cup B$ (A *union* B) is the event that *A or B or both occur*.
- The set $A \cap B$ (A *intersection* B) is the event that **both** *A and B both occur*.
- The event $A^c$ (A *complement*) is the event that A does *not* occur.
- If $A \subset B$ (is a *subset* of B) then event A is said to *imply* event B.

Two events A and B which have no outcomes in common, that is, $A \cap B = \varnothing$, are called *disjoint* events.

## Example 1.7 - System Reliability

Let $A_{i}$ be the event that the $i^{th}$ component is functioning, $i = 1,2,3$  and let $D_{a}, D_{b}, D_{c}$ be the events that respectively the series, parallel and 2-out-of-3 system is functioning. Then, 
$$
D_{a}=A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap A_{3}
$$
And
$$
D_{b}=A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup A_{3}
$$
Also,
$$
\begin{align*}
D_{c} &= (A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap A_{3}) \cup (A_{1}^c \cap A_{2} \cap A_{3}) \cup (A_{1} \cap A_{2}^c \cap A_{3}) \cup (A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap A_{3}^c) \\ 
&= (A_{1} \cap A_{2}) \cup (A_{1} \cap A_{3}) \cup (A_{2} \cup A_{3})
\end{align*}
$$
Two useful results in the theory of sets are the following, due to **De Morgan**: If $\{ A_{i} \}$ is a collection of events then
$$
\left( \bigcup_{i} A_{i} \right)^c = \bigcap_{i} A_{i}^c
$$
And
$$
\left( \bigcap_{i} A_{i} \right)^c = \bigcup_{i} A_{i}^c
$$
