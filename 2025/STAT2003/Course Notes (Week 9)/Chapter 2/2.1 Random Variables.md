# 2.1 Random Variables
Formally, a *random variable* is a *function* from the sample space $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Here is a concrete example:

### Example 2.1 (Sum of Two Dice)
Suppose we toss two fair dice and note their sum. If we throw the dice one by one and observe each throw, the sample space is $\Omega = \{ (1,1),\dots,(6,6) \}$. The function, $X$, defined by $x$
