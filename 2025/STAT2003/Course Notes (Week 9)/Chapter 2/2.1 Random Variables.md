# 2.1 Random Variables
Formally, a *random variable* is a *function* from the sample space $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Here is a concrete example:

### Example 2.1 (Sum of Two Dice)
Suppose we toss two fair dice and note their sum. If we throw the dice one by one and observe each throw, the sample space is $\Omega = \{ (1,1),\dots,(6,6) \}$. The function, $X$, defined by $X(i,j)=i+j$, is a random variable, which maps the outcome $(i,j)$ to the sum $i+j$. Note that all the outcomes in the "encircled" set are mapped to 8. This is the set of all outcomes whose sum is 8. A natural notation for this set is to write $\{ X=8 \}$ Since this set has 5 outcomes, and all outcomes in $\Omega$ are equally likely, we have
$$
\mathbb{P}(\{ X=8 \})=\frac{5}{36}
$$
