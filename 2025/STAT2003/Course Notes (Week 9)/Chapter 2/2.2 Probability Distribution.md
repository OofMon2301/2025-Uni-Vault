# 2.2 Probability Distribution

---
Let $X$ be a random variable. We would like to specify the probabilities of events such as $\{ X=x \}$ and $\{ a \leq X \leq b \}$.

If we can specify all probabilities involving $X$, we say that we have specified the **probability distribution** of $X$.

One way to specify the probability distribution is to give the probabilities of all events of the form $\{  X \leq x \}, x \in \mathbb{R}$. This leads to the following definition:

## Definition 2.1: Cumulative Distribution Function
The *cumulative distribution function* (cdf) of a random variable $X$ is the function $F: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ defined by:
$$
F(x) := \mathbb{P}(X \leq x), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
$$

Note that above we should have written $\mathbb{P}(\{ X \leq x \})$ instead of $\mathbb{P}(X \leq x)$. From now on, we will use this type of abbreviation.

The following properties for $F$ are a direct consequence of the three Axioms for $\mathbb{P}$.

1. $F$ is right-continuous: $\lim_{ h \to 0 }F(x+h) = F(x)$
2. $F$ is increasing: $x \leq y \implies F(x) \leq F(y)$.
3.  $0 \leq F(x) \leq 1$.

### 2.2.1 - Discrete Distributions

##  Definition 2.2: Discrete Distributions
We say that $X$ has a *discrete* distribution if $X$ is a discrete random variable. In particular, for some i
