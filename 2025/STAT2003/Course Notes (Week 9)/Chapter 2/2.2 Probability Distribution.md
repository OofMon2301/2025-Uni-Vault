# 2.2 Probability Distribution

---
Let $X$ be a random variable. We would like to specify the probabilities of events such as $\{ X=x \}$ and $\{ a \leq X \leq b \}$.

If we can specify all probabilities involving $X$, we say that we have specified the **probability distribution** of $X$.

One way to specify the probability distribution is to give the probabilities of all events of the form $\{  X \leq x \}, x \in \mathbb{R}$. This leads to the following definition:

## Definition 2.1: Cumulative Distribution Function
The *cumulative distribution function* (cdf) of a random variable $X$ is the function $F: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ defined by:
$$
F_{9}X
